title: Blog - Learning Experiences 
---

Over the course of this semester, I have developed my programming skills in and out of 
class with the guidance of my teacher. This has allowed me to learn web development (HTML),
a previously foreign concept to myself. I was also introduced to Java and Javascript which 
can work with HTML but is not limited to just so. I was taught how to program hardware such 
as a **Micro:bit** and a **Micro Processor**. These experiences expanded my possibilites
as previously I had no (next to no) experience programming hardware. Some paths this has 
opened include robotics has well as other fields that might find programming hardware useful.
Another thing I have learnt are _algorithms_. Before I knew very little compared to what I 
know now and applying that knowledge to not only programming but simple tasks can make life 
much easier. An example of this is a rubiks cube, where after learning a few algorithms, 
the task is many times easier. One final thing that I have learned that I will be sharing is 
a **_"get it done"_** mentallity. This mentallity allows you to get stuff completed in an 
effecient manner rather than spending all your time on making one thing "perfect". This will 
help you make better use of your time and of course you can always go back and improve your 
work at a later date. Now although there is a lot more I could say about what I learnt, I am 
going to end it here as I feel this blog is long enough as it is.

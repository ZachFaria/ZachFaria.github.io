title: Future Intentions
---

Although I am not completely sure about what I want in the future, I now that I want 
to pursue progrmming as a career. The reason I want to is because I do enjoy creating 
things (programs) on the computer. This means that if I were to persue this as a career,
I will end up relatively happy, which is fairly important for a lifetime career.To do 
so I will continue coding on my own time, learn more about it, continue to learn new 
languages and pratice ones I am familiar with. This is kind of the direction I am headed 
in and I want to continue in this direction. This are more or less a general description
of my future plans.

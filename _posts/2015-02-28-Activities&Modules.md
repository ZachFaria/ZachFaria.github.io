Throughout the semester, I have worked on _[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/)_ to learn and complete various 
courses (related to computer science of course) such as **Inro to HTML, Intro to JS, Natural Simulations, 
Algorithms, Intro to SQL and HTML/CSS with jQuery**. In addition to Khan Academy, I also
learnt from **_Daniel Shiffman's Coding train videos_**. I also successfully programmed hardware
with a group. Such hardware includes a **[Micro:bit](https://microbit.org/)** and a **Micro Processor**. These experiences 
throughout this semester have further enhanced my learning in the field of computer science.
